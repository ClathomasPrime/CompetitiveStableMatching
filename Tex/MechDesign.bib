  abstract = {The college admissions problem is perhaps the simplest model of
    many-to-one matching in two-sided markets such as labor markets. We show
    that the set of stable outcomes (which is equal to the core defined by
    weak domination) has some surprising properties not found in models
    of one-to-one matching. These properties may help to explain the
    success that this kind of model has had in explaining empirical
    observations.

    Basically, in college-proposing DA, a college can ``kick itself out'' of a
    highly-valued student, cause a different college to propose to the student,
    and end up loosing him/her.
    Also, there exist non-stable matching which are preferred by every college to
    the college-optimal stable matching.

    The big breakthrough -- being unbalanced has a huge effect on the average
    structure of the core of stable matching markets.
    Studies two statistics -- the average rank of agents for their match,
    and the percentage of agents with multiple stable partners.
    Bounds on the expectation of these statistics, as well as their convergence
    with probability approaching 1, is derived.

    Inspired by AshlagiUnbalancedCompetition17, this guy returned to the
    analysis of matching markets. He proves basically tight bounds on the
    expectation of relevant statistics (lots of these are just the less
    interesting directions of the bounds from Ashlagi)
    and studies the average *number* of stable matches
    (this is also reduced from the balanced case, but not as dramatically).

    Attempts to use *short preference lists* to say that the core is typically
    small in random matching markets. While preference lists are indeed short
    in practice, AshlagiUnbalancedCompetition17 thinks this paper misses the
    mark because the lists must be so short that 1) agents have a positive
    chance of going unmatched and 2) many agents on the opposing side are
    ranked by no applicant.
